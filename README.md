## 🌍 About Me
Passionate software engineer exploring the intersection of **clean code**, **AI**, and **open‑source**. I love digging into system design, writing elegant, testable code, and sharing what I learn with the community. Based in the **San Francisco Bay Area**, I’m always on the lookout for cool projects, new languages, and challenging problems.
